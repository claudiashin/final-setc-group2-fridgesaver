Season it with salt and let it brown over a medium heat until the carrots get a bit softer. During that time cook the pasta and prepare the breadcrumbs. Pasta cooking: Check the instructions on its packaging and cook the pasta for 1 minute less than indicated (it will finish cooking once mixed with carrots). RESERVE half a cup of water from pasta cooking. Breadcrumbs: cut your bread into smaller pieces/crumbs. I use my mini food processor to do that but you could do with a grater or simply with a knife. Next, roast them until golden on a dry frying pan. To finish add olive oil and sprinkle with flaky salt.",
